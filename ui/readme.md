Seattle Crime

# Iteration 1

For iteration 1, we started our project using the boilerplate code from the Pro-MERN Book. This includes both the API and UI folders. So far, we have implemented a Home page with a Google Map and a filter to filter the types of crimes that are displayed. We have also started a "Reports" page though it is not fully functional yet. We also have a "Discussion" page where users could post their comments based on their experience but it is not fully functional yet.

Team Contributions:

Surendra: Worked on Discussion page to add comments on button click, working on connecting state to DB.
